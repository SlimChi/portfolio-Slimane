## Hangman  game

> Hangman  game

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game designed for fun and entertainment. In this game, one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The word to be guessed is initially represented by a series of underscores, each underscore representing a letter in the word.

The game typically follows these steps:

Word Selection: The game starts with one player selecting a word secretly. This word is often related to a specific category, such as animals, fruits, or countries.

Word Representation: The selected word is then represented using underscores, indicating the number of letters in the word.

Letter Guessing: The other player starts guessing letters one by one. If the guessed letter is present in the word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of a hangman figure is drawn.

Limited Attempts: The player guessing the word has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word. The game typically ends when the word is guessed correctly, or the hangman figure is completed.

Outcome: If the word is guessed correctly within the allowed attempts, the guesser wins. If the hangman figure is completed before the word is guessed, the player who selected the word wins.

JavaScript Implementation: The game can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript will handle the logic of word selection, representation, letter checking, and updating the display. CSS can be used for styling, and HTML for structuring the game interface.

User Interaction: The game provides a user-friendly interface for entering letter guesses and displays the current state of the word, the hangman figure, and the guessed letters.

Scalability: The game can be extended to include additional features such as difficulty levels, score tracking, and a variety of word categories, making it an engaging and entertaining experience for players of all ages.
