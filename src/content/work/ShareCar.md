Carpooling Project Overview

Introduction:
Our carpooling application introduces a unique approach to ridesharing, minimizing monetary transactions and emphasizing a point-based system. The primary goal is to connect individuals for shared car journeys, where points, rather than money, facilitate the exchange. For instance, when a driver covers a 20km trip, they earn 20 points, while the passenger consumes 20 points. Upon registration, users receive an initial credit of 50 points. Non-car owners can also purchase points, and a system is in place for users to sell their points to others.
