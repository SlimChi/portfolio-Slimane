Project Overview: Vacation Rental Reservation Platform for PROGICA

Madame Eva Khance, Director of the Association of Rural Cottage Owners (PROGICA), envisions streamlining and enhancing the reservation management process by introducing an online booking platform. To assess your responsiveness and professionalism, she entrusts you with the initial task of designing an internal tool to catalog all rental properties and implement search functionalities. Initial reservations will be made directly with the property owner.

Each cottage's details will include the owner's information, contact person details, and availability hours.
Essential property information such as location, living space, number of bedrooms, and sleeping capacity must be recorded.
If the cottage accommodates pets, the corresponding fee should be indicated.
Access to weekly rental rates based on seasonal periods (High, Medium, Low) is crucial.
Period dates are contingent on the property's location (Sea, Mountains, Disney, Ast√©rix).
Search criteria for finding a cottage will encompass:

Geographical criteria: region, department, city. When the criterion is a city, users should have the option to expand the search radius by specifying the maximum distance.
Equipment criteria:
Interior: dishwasher, washing machine, air conditioning, television.
Exterior: terrace, barbecue, private or shared pool, tennis, ping-pong.
Service criteria: linen rental, end-of-stay cleaning, internet access.
If certain services or amenities incur charges, their costs must be clearly indicated.

This comprehensive tool aims to provide a seamless experience for both cottage owners and prospective renters, offering detailed property information and advanced search capabilities. The platform will revolutionize the cottage rental landscape, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced user satisfaction.
